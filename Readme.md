# Fluid

- cross-platform (js & macos native so far)
- animation-focused (trying to make a pit of success for UI animations & gestures)
- react-inspired (we've got hooks & jsx)

**Stability level:** not at all

## Trying the js demo:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ open index.html # to view it in your browser
$ npm run pack # this starts the packager
```

Then edit `src/js/App.re` to see things change.


## Trying the native demo:
Macos only at the moment

```
$ npm run native
$ ./lib/bs/native/appnative.native
```
